# VocabBreak - Quick Start Guide

## 🚀 MVP Setup (5 minutes)

Your VocabBreak extension is now ready for MVP testing! All critical integration issues have been resolved.

### Prerequisites
- ✅ `.env` file with your Supabase credentials (already set)
- ✅ Node.js installed
- ✅ Chrome browser

### Step 1: Build the Extension
```bash
npm run build
```

This will:
- Read your `.env` file
- Inject Supabase credentials into the extension
- Prepare the extension for loading

### Step 2: Set Up Database
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Open the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the entire contents of `database/schema.sql`
4. Click "Run" to create all tables and indexes

### Step 3: Load Extension in Chrome
1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top right)
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select your VocabBreak project folder
5. The extension should load successfully!

### Step 4: Initial Setup
1. Click the VocabBreak icon in Chrome toolbar
2. The popup will automatically set up credentials from your build
3. Create a Supabase account or sign in
4. Configure your learning preferences in the options page

## ✅ What's Now Working

### Fixed Integration Issues:
- ✅ **Supabase Client**: Now loads via CDN in HTML files
- ✅ **Credentials**: Automatically injected from your `.env` file
- ✅ **Module Loading**: Browser extension compatible format
- ✅ **Background Integration**: Service worker can access Supabase
- ✅ **Offline Sync**: Properly integrated with new client methods

### Core MVP Features Ready:
- ✅ **User Authentication**: Sign up/in with Supabase

- ✅ **Progress Tracking**: Rich interaction analytics
- ✅ **Gamification**: Points, streaks, achievements
- ✅ **Offline Support**: IndexedDB caching with sync
- ✅ **Site Blocking**: Configurable whitelist/blacklist

## 🧪 Testing Your MVP

### 1. Test Authentication
- Open the extension popup
- Try signing up with a new account
- Verify you can sign in/out

### 2. Test Database Connection
- Check browser console for any errors
- Verify user profile is created in Supabase dashboard

### 3. Test Basic Flow
- Visit a website (like reddit.com)
- The extension should eventually show a question overlay
- Answer correctly to proceed

## 📁 File Changes Made

### Core Integration Fixes:
- `shared/supabase-client.js` - Browser extension compatible
- `shared/setup-credentials.js` - Credential management
- `background.js` - Supabase integration
- `shared/offline-manager.js` - Updated sync methods
- `manifest.json` - Added required scripts and CDN access
- `popup/popup.html` - Supabase CDN loading
- `options/options.html` - Supabase CDN loading
- `package.json` - Build scripts added
- `scripts/build.js` - Automated credential injection

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### Making Changes:
```bash
# After any .env changes, rebuild
npm run build

# Then reload extension in Chrome
# Go to chrome://extensions/ and click reload button
```

### Adding Questions:
1. Use the Supabase dashboard
2. Insert into the `questions` table
3. Use the flexible JSONB format from the schema

### Monitoring:
